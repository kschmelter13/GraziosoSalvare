# GraziosoSalvare

This is a rescue animal logging and checking system for a mock company that trains rescue animals.

This was created for my foundation in application development class, and uses OOP concepts to manage the program.

Following the prompted instructions on the screen you can input rescue dogs and monkeys into the system, update, and print out information.
